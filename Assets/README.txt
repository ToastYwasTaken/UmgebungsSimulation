All Assets imported from Unity are in UsedAssets
Additional created assets in OwnAssets (shader graph for water...).
The simulated "highlights" show POI where i placed simulation highlights, like animated water.
I recreated effects like water-shader, watersplash-effect, fire-effect ..
When starting the game you can fly to a desired destination and look at everything in realtime.
