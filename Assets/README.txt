All Assets imported from Unity are in UsedAssets
Additional created assets in OwnAssets (shader graph for water...).
The simulated "highlights" show POI where i placed simulation highlights, like animated water.
I recreated effects like water-shader, watersplash-effect, fire-effect. 
The ones i did not create myself but were used in scene are in "Used Assets".
When starting the game you can fly to a desired destination and look at everything in realtime.
NOTE: APOCALYPTIC WORLDPACK & GRASS FLOWER PACKS HAS TO BE IMPORTED

Scene-Highlights:

-Water:
	- I used a water shader and placed Splash-particle-systems to the waterfall.

-Destroyed bridge:
	- Destroyed burning cars (fire-particle-system)
	- Destroyed bridge
	- Spark-effect on electric cables 

-Snowy hills:
	- Added appropriate textures on terrain
	- Adjusted the material on the trees to make them look snowy.

-Day-Night-Cycle:
	-Adjustable day-night-cylce

Bugs:

	- The project somehow has to recreate the shaders from URP each time...
